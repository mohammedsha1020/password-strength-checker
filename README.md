## Password Strength Checker

A simple Python application built using **Tkinter** to evaluate and display the strength of a password in real-time. The application visually indicates the strength of the password with both text and a progress bar.

## Features

- **Real-time evaluation**: Checks password strength as you type.
- **Visual feedback**: Displays strength as text (e.g., "Very Weak", "Moderate", "Strong") and a color-coded progress bar.
- **Criteria-based analysis**: Considers length, uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters.
- **User-friendly interface**: Built with Tkinter for a clean and simple UI.
